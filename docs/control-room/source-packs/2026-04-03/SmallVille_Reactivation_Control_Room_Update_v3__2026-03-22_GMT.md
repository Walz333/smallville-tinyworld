# SmallVille / UEIA / CTO Reactivation Control Room Update v3

**Timestamp:** 2026-04-03 GMT (refreshed from 2026-03-22 original)  
**Status:** Current primary management-layer restart source  
**Intended use:** First file to load in a fresh CTO session and concise authority handoff source for Codex sessions

## 1. Current accepted operating position

SmallVille-as-lived-world remains the product.

UEIA remains the governance, audit, and control scaffold around the product.

This control room stays at **CTO management level** unless a bounded lane is intentionally opened.

Codex app is now the preferred live repo execution surface for:
- current `HEAD` verification
- working-tree inspection
- exact file and path confirmation
- focused test execution
- review-only classification lanes
- bounded implementation when explicitly authorized

This CTO chat remains the preferred management surface for:
- authority loading
- lane choice
- drift control
- seam selection
- checkpoint interpretation
- generation of one bounded Codex prompt at a time

VBC remains a valid oversight and comparison surface only.
It is not the primary execution surface.

## 2. Current authority map

### Top control
- **CTO Command Interface** = sole top command-and-control AI layer
- **Northbridge** = team-facing alias for that same CTO Command Interface layer
- **Callum** = human operator gate with explicit pause / hold authority

### Explorer layer
- **Carson** = main Explorer
- **Russell** = wider team member only, not Explorer lead and not a command layer

### Sub-agent rule
No sub-agent protocol, specialist role, operator surface, or fixture-consumer profile has command-interface status, final approval authority, or autonomous seam-reopen authority.

## 3. Latest carried repo state

### Branch / HEAD / working tree
- Branch: `main`
- Latest carried management `HEAD`: `104bd46` (`feat: cherry-pick Codex KEEP-group`)
- Tracked tree: clean
- `git diff --stat`: empty (docs-only commits on top)

### Previously parked items — now resolved
All five March 22 residue items have been dispositioned:
- `docs/contracts/smallville-memory-triplet-schema-v1.md` — ACTIVE AUTHORITY (tracked contract, Java-referenced)
- `docs/contracts/smallville-reflection-and-retrieval-v1.md` — ACTIVE AUTHORITY (tracked contract, Java-referenced)
- `output/` — gitignored via `.gitignore`
- `tmp/` — gitignored via `.gitignore`
- `twohousev.1` — absent from filesystem, no action needed

See `docs/handover/residue-disposition-checkpoint-2026-04-03.md` for full disposition table.

### Latest landed implementation commits
- `5f4e405` — `feat(sidecar): add sidecar-packet-assembler-v1`
- `104bd46` — `feat: cherry-pick Codex KEEP-group — ledger classes, sim orchestrator, governance tooling`

## 4. Live organism position

The active default SmallVille organism remains the **two-house seed**.

Carried verified position:
- the default gate still routes `config.yaml` and `simulation.yaml` into `scenarios/two-house-garden-v1`
- the scenario remains the live bootstrap seed
- prompt and simulation wiring remain coherent against that seed unless future repo inspection disproves it

## 5. Current seam posture

### Frozen and closed
- proposal invalid-ID runtime seam
- runtime-polish ChatService checkpointed cluster

### Frozen and active as baseline
- March 21 `/models` ask-shadow runtime-surface checkpoint
- bounded ask-shadow bridge seam frozen in repo code at `b2aef007`
- sidecar-packet-assembler-v1 at `5f4e405`
- Codex KEEP-group cherry-pick (ledger classes, sim orchestrator, governance tooling) at `104bd46`

### Parked
- `Garden: on` / object-state family
- broad retrieval redesign
- broad reflection redesign
- memory-triplet contract work unless chosen as its own lane
- reflection-and-retrieval contract work unless chosen as its own lane
- remote escalation enablement
- direct Python world mutation
- broad multi-path bridge adoption beyond the frozen ask-path shadow seam
- broad toolchain or UI redesign

## 6. Current working interpretation

The ask-shadow bridge seam is no longer merely a working-tree seam.

It is now part of committed repo history.

That means the management layer should stop talking about the bridge as if it only exists in dirty working state.

However, the source-package prose still lags the repo state and the workspace still carries some untracked residue that could cause authority ambiguity.

## 7. Default control-room rule

When this file is used to reactivate a session, the default behavior should be:

1. load authority from this file first
2. stay at CTO management level
3. treat live repo inspection as higher authority than carried prose when Codex is available
4. choose one bounded lane only
5. generate one Codex prompt only unless explicitly asked otherwise
6. do not reopen closed seams by momentum
7. do not treat parked files, untracked drafts, or conversational carry-state as active authority by default

## 8. Corrected source loading order

1. this file
2. `SmallVille_CTO_Autoload_Execution_Profile_v1.4__2026-03-22_GMT.md`
3. `smallville-ueia-control-model-org-chart-v2__2026-03-22_GMT.md`
4. `agent-role-matrix-v2__2026-03-22_GMT.md`
5. `SmallVille_New_Session_CTO_Reactivation_Protocol_v4__2026-03-22_GMT.md`
6. repo checkpoint chain in `docs/handover/`
7. live repo code and focused tests
8. `SmallVille_Northbridge_Master_State__2026-03-22_GMT.md`
9. older lineage files only for historical continuity

## 9. Package discipline

This replacement package keeps older files available as lineage, but removes them from the active default load order.

It also makes three corrections:
- updates the carried management `HEAD`
- records the ask-shadow seam as frozen repo reality
- records the current residue ambiguity so it does not become invisible drift

## 10. Current blocked categories

The following remain blocked unless a future lane explicitly reopens them:
- proposal invalid-ID rework
- ChatService runtime-polish reopening
- `Garden: on` / object-state repair without new live evidence
- control-model redesign
- memory-lattice redesign
- retrieval redesign
- mutation-authority transfer to Python
- broad bridge widening
- broad governance recursion
- broad multi-lane widening from a single prompt

## 11. Current recommended next lane

### Active next lane
`bounded implementation: AffectState reconciliation or next implementation seam`

### Why this is next
Residue disposition is complete. Source-pack prose is refreshed.
The repo is clean and the authority map is current.
The next productive work is a bounded implementation lane.

### Candidate lanes
- AffectState reconciliation (align Java affect model with current schema contracts)
- sidecar integration review (verify sidecar-packet-assembler-v1 wiring against live organism)
- test coverage expansion for newly landed KEEP-group classes

## 12. When to update this file next

Update this file only when one of the following changes:
- `HEAD` changes in a way relevant to active authority
- a new checkpoint lands
- the control-model hierarchy changes
- the live default organism changes
- the residue lane resolves authority-sensitive noise
- the recommended next posture changes
