# Proposal Runtime Feature Checkpoint

Date: 2026-03-20

## Checkpoint Purpose

This checkpoint records that the bounded proposal-runtime feature family is now proven end-to-end in repo reality.

It exists to consolidate one closed evidence sequence only:
- proposal emergence through runtime update
- proposal review and apply behavior
- action history at service level
- snapshot exposure of proposal history and pending visibility
- approve/reject endpoint contract behavior

It does not reopen design, broaden the proposal system, or start a new implementation seam.

## Feature Slice Scope

This checkpoint freezes the proposal-runtime feature family only.

Included:
- proposal emergence through `updateState`
- proposal queue visibility and review path evidence
- approve and reject behavior
- proposal action history evidence at service and snapshot level
- review endpoint contract payload stability evidence

Explicitly excluded:
- equality-with-now work
- planning freshness work
- prompt redesign
- runtime redesign beyond the already-proven proposal family
- API redesign beyond the already-proven contract surface
- UI, workflow, toolchain, or scenario work
- any unrelated untracked files

## Starting Anchor Before Proposal-Runtime Evidence Sequence

Starting HEAD before the proposal-runtime evidence sequence:
- `bd6bb844db39d5810528bb3a94a8f8bfa8adce4a`

This is the repo anchor immediately before the first proposal-runtime evidence commit.

## Ending HEAD After Latest Proposal Endpoint Contract Evidence

Ending HEAD after the latest proposal endpoint contract evidence:
- `12b86656e8cc776c00b3c6af71aca0b5d9f772b0`

## Exact Test Outcomes Across the Sequence

Focused outcomes recorded across the proposal-runtime evidence sequence:

## What Behavior Is Now Proven

The proposal-runtime feature family is now proven end-to-end.

Specifically proven:
- proposal emergence through `updateState` is proven
- pending proposal queue visibility is proven
- approve behavior is proven
- reject behavior is proven
- review/apply behavior is proven
- action history is proven at service level
- action history is proven at snapshot/API level
- endpoint contract payloads are proven stable and coherent
- returned approve and reject payloads line up with subsequent `/world` snapshot state
- operator-readable proposal fields remain stable across the review endpoint contract surface

## What Production Defects Were Or Were Not Found

The proposal family required no production repair in the queueing, review/apply, history, or API contract sequence.

Explicit outcome:
- no production defect was found in the proposal seam family during the evidence ladder
- no controller repair was required
- no service repair was required
- no entity or DTO repair was required
- the sequence closed as evidence-first verification, not runtime defect correction

## What Remains Intentionally Parked

Still intentionally parked:
- equality-with-now remains parked
- planning freshness seam family remains closed and parked
- broader proposal-system redesign remains out of scope
- prompt changes remain out of scope
- non-proposal runtime redesign remains out of scope

## Drift Boundaries Preserved

The proposal-runtime evidence ladder preserved the required drift boundaries:
- unrelated untracked files remained out of scope throughout
- no production repair was required
- no prompt work was reopened
- no planning freshness seam was reopened
- equality-with-now was not reopened
- no architecture redesign was opened
- no documentation was introduced during the test evidence sequence itself
- the current documentation lane changes only this one markdown file

Current unrelated untracked files that remained out of scope:
- `docs/contracts/smallville-memory-triplet-schema-v1.md`
- `docs/contracts/smallville-reflection-and-retrieval-v1.md`
- `twohousev.1`

## Recommended Next Bounded Lane

Recommended next bounded lane:
- review-only confirmation of whether invalid proposal ID error behavior should be explicitly frozen in one narrow endpoint-contract checkpoint or left implicit under the existing global exception contract, without reopening proposal runtime implementation
