# Review Surface Drill Outcome Interpretation Rules v1

## Purpose

This note defines how approved consumer profiles may assign bounded downstream meaning to already-derived drill outcomes without creating new authority.

## Core Distinctions

Consuming a drill outcome means bounded read-only downstream use of an already-derived pre-decision drill artifact.

Drill outcome consumption remains pre-decision only and may not become review decision handling, approval handling, workflow handling, execution handling, or control handling.

Interpreting a consumed drill outcome means assigning bounded review meaning to a pre-decision outcome without elevating it into review decision handling, approval handling, workflow handling, execution handling, or control handling.

Stopping on consumed drill outcomes means preserving unresolved hard-stop meaning whenever it is present and refusing to treat the consumed outcome as cleared, resolved, routed, or advisory-only.

## Review-Decision Boundary

A consumed drill outcome may reference a promoted review decision fixture as subject matter only and may not replace, extend, restate, or simulate a canonical review decision.

The hard distinction remains explicit:

- drill outcome = pre-decision artifact
- review decision = approval-boundary artifact

## Interpretation Rules By Outcome Family

### `drill-summary`

`drill-summary` may be consumed as a review aid only and may not be treated as completed review, approval, or decision.

Interpretation of `drill-summary` is limited to bounded review understanding, provenance-aware reading, and boundary-preserving downstream orientation.

### `drill-pause-note`

`drill-pause-note` may preserve drift-pause context only and may not create queued work, deferred workflow state, backlog semantics, or correction authority.

Interpretation of `drill-pause-note` is limited to recognizing preserved pause context around drift or boundary risk while remaining pre-decision only.

### `drill-stop-outcome`

Consuming a `drill-stop-outcome` must preserve that the hard stop remains unresolved unless human review separately resolves it.

Interpretation of `drill-stop-outcome` is limited to recognizing unresolved hard-stop context and preserving the halt requirement. It may not be reinterpreted as downstream clearance, execution-ready meaning, or discretionary guidance.

### `drill-handoff-note`

Consuming a `drill-handoff-note` may preserve human handoff only and may not become execution handoff, workflow routing, transfer state, or downstream clearance.

Interpretation of `drill-handoff-note` is limited to bounded human handoff context while preserving canonical source-of-truth rules, pre-decision boundaries, and review-decision separation.

## Cross-Family Preservation Rules

A consumed drill outcome may preserve review-only context, drift-pause context, unresolved hard-stop context, or human-handoff context only.

All interpretation of consumed drill outcomes must preserve:

- canonical fixture files at canonical paths as source of truth
- drill outcomes as pre-decision artifacts only
- review decisions as separate approval-boundary artifacts only
- Water Mill as design-asset-derived context only
- packet as interpretive artifact only, never runtime world state
- single-dossier continuity
- no runtime authority
- no mutation authority
- no execution authority
- no approval inflation
- no workflow-state inflation
- no canonical replacement

## Explicit Stop Conditions

Stop if interpretation wording:

- upgrades a consumed drill outcome into review-decision handling
- treats a consumed drill outcome as workflow state, approval state, execution state, or control state
- downgrades a `drill-stop-outcome` into advisory-only or resolved wording
- treats a `drill-handoff-note` as execution handoff, workflow routing, transfer state, or downstream clearance
- treats packet content as runtime world state
- treats Water Mill design-asset-derived context as observed built authority without accepted evidence
- weakens single-dossier continuity
- implies runtime authority, mutation authority, execution authority, approval inflation, canonical replacement, or workflow-state inflation
