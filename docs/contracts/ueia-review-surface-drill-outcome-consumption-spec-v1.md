# UEIA Review Surface Drill Outcome Consumption Spec v1

## Purpose

This specification defines the bounded read-only consumption layer for already-derived review-surface drill outcomes inside the frozen UEIA governance ladder. It describes how approved consumer profiles may consume those pre-decision artifacts without changing authority, weakening source-of-truth discipline, or drifting into tooling, schemas, runtime behavior, workflow engines, routing logic, or UI design.

## Upstream Authority

This layer remains subordinate to the frozen:

- canonical fixture authority
- consumer profile authority
- conformance authority
- capability crosswalk authority
- diagnostic-output authority
- diagnostic-output consumption authority
- review-surface authority
- review-surface drill authority
- review-surface drill outcome authority

## In-Scope Fixtures

Only these canonical fixtures are in scope:

- `docs/examples/promoted-archive-record-v1.md`
- `docs/examples/promoted-derived-packet-v1.md`
- `docs/examples/promoted-agent-brief-v1.md`
- `docs/examples/promoted-review-decision-v1.md`

## In-Scope Consumer Profiles

Only these approved consumer profiles are in scope:

- `Fixture Reader`
- `Fixture Comparator`
- `Fixture Diagnostics Consumer`
- `Fixture Export Consumer`

## In-Scope Drill Outcome Families

Only these frozen drill outcome families are in scope:

- `drill-summary`
- `drill-pause-note`
- `drill-stop-outcome`
- `drill-handoff-note`

## Consumption Model

Consuming a drill outcome means bounded read-only downstream use of an already-derived pre-decision drill artifact.

Drill outcome consumption remains pre-decision only and may not become review decision handling, approval handling, workflow handling, execution handling, or control handling.

A consumed drill outcome may preserve review-only context, drift-pause context, unresolved hard-stop context, or human-handoff context only.

Consuming a `drill-stop-outcome` must preserve that the hard stop remains unresolved unless human review separately resolves it.

Consuming a `drill-handoff-note` may preserve human handoff only and may not become execution handoff, workflow routing, transfer state, or downstream clearance.

A consumed drill outcome may reference a promoted review decision fixture as subject matter only and may not replace, extend, restate, or simulate a canonical review decision.

The hard distinctions remain explicit:

- drill outcome = pre-decision artifact
- drill outcome consumption = bounded read-only downstream use of a pre-decision artifact
- review decision = approval-boundary artifact

## Source-of-Truth Rule

Canonical fixture files at canonical paths remain the source of truth wherever drill outcomes are consumed, read, or handed forward.

## Pre-Decision Rule

Consumed drill outcomes remain pre-decision artifacts only. Consumption may orient human review and preserve bounded downstream meaning, but it may not become review-decision handling, may not simulate approval, and may not compress L3 review work into L4 human approval.

## Non-Authoritative And Non-Replacing Rule

All consumed drill outcomes remain derived only, non-authoritative, and non-replacing. No consumed drill outcome may imply runtime authority, mutation authority, execution authority, approval inflation, canonical replacement, or workflow-state inflation.

## Boundary Preservation Rules

- Water Mill remains design-asset-derived context only within consumed drill outcomes and may not be restated as observed built authority without accepted evidence.
- Packet content remains interpretive artifact only within consumed drill outcomes and may not be restated as runtime world state.
- Single-dossier continuity remains explicit within consumed drill outcomes and may not be weakened by outcome-consumption wording.
- Review-decision boundaries remain explicit within consumed drill outcomes and may not be weakened by downstream wording.
- Canonical-path visibility remains explicit wherever a consumed drill outcome refers to an in-scope fixture or prior outcome context.

## No-Runtime Boundary

This specification does not authorize runtime behavior, runtime state creation, runtime hooks, runtime mutation, runtime approval, runtime control, or runtime-coupled outcome-consumption behavior.

## No-Mutation Boundary

This specification does not authorize canonical rewrite, canonical replacement, fixture mutation, inferred-to-observed promotion, silent repair, or downstream correction authority.

## No-Execution Boundary

This specification does not authorize execution handling, execution clearance, execution routing, control behavior, or executable handoff semantics.

## No-Approval-Inflation Boundary

This specification does not authorize approval substitution, review-decision simulation, approval-ready wording, or any outcome-consumption language that would replace, extend, restate, or simulate a canonical review decision.

## No-Workflow-State Boundary

This specification does not authorize workflow state, queue semantics, routing semantics, backlog semantics, transfer semantics, deferred-work semantics, or other process-tracking behavior disguised as review-only consumption language.

## Support Matrix

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Outcome-consumption definitions | Supported | Limited to bounded read-only downstream use |
| Outcome-family consumption matrix | Supported | Limited to the four approved outcome families |
| Interpretation rules for consumed outcomes | Supported | Pre-decision only |
| Boundary-preserving examples | Supported | Illustrative only |
| Tooling, validators, or scripts | Not supported | Forbidden in this phase |
| Runtime or workflow behavior | Not supported | Forbidden in this phase |
| Review-decision replacement or simulation | Not supported | Forbidden in this phase |
| UI, schemas, packaging, or mirrors | Not supported | Forbidden in this phase |

## Explicit Stop Conditions

Stop if any drafting or later pass:

- widens scope beyond the four canonical fixtures
- widens scope beyond the four approved consumer profiles
- widens scope beyond the four frozen drill outcome families
- collapses outcome consumption into review-decision handling
- collapses outcome consumption into workflow state, approval state, execution state, or control state
- weakens unresolved hard-stop semantics
- weakens canonical source-of-truth rules
- weakens Water Mill boundary discipline
- weakens packet/world-state separation
- weakens single-dossier continuity
- implies replacement authority, runtime authority, mutation authority, execution authority, approval inflation, or workflow-state inflation
- drifts into tooling, schemas, runtime behavior, workflow engines, routing logic, or UI design
